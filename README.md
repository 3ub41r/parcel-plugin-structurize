A [Parcel][parcel] plugin that lets you organize your build directory into any structure.

## Why?

Currently, Parcel builds everything for production in a flat structure. Sometimes, we might need a particular structure or might just prefer having a structure in the build folder.

This plugin runs only in `build` and let's you organize your scripts, styles and assets into folders.

## Configuration

The configuration structure is still in its nascent stages. You can follow the updates and discussions in the [`v2` roadmap][v2] thread
